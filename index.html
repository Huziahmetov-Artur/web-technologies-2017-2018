            In all seriousness, we can pretty much write whatever we want here and chances are, nobody will notice.</p>

    <p>They just scan it. They glance at it in the same way you glance at advertisements in a magazine.
        Don’t believe us? Just think about this for a second. Think about your own browsing behavior.
        How many times have you Googled a website, clicked on one of the first results,
        waited for the page to load, scrolled down, scrolled back up and then gone back to the results
        page? We’re guessing more than once.</p>
    <p>Ten years ago you were wondering whether you even needed a website. Nowadays the question is:
        What can you do to your website so it will stop being invisible to your potential customers?</p>
    <p>You need to be authentic — you can’t fake it anymore. The new consumer is choosier and more
        knowledgeable than ever before. They just won’t consume brands, nor spend time on websites that
        don’t ooze authenticity, passion and quality. Why should they? They’ve got so many options to
        choose from and so little time to make their choices.</p>
    <p>This is where we come in. Through a streamlined, five-milestone process we will <span class="smallcaps">plan, design,
        build, launch</span> and <span class="smallcaps">manage</span> your professional and high-impact online
        presence for your company. </p>

        Once information is collected, it is processed into a plan. This step strategically outlines future tactics, budget,
        timeline and technology needs for the project.
        We ask questions, we gather your ideas, learn your business objectives and wrap our minds around what needs to be accomplished.</figcaption></figure>
    <figure><div class="second_circule"><h2>DESIGN</h2></div><figcaption><em>Burning the midnight oil</em><br>With the plan established, design and concept begin taking shape. The design process is best
        described as a funnel of ideas based on the objectives.
        Through constant refinement of our initial sketches (and a few gallons of coffee) we are able to narrow down a single sharp solution.</figcaption></figure>
    <figure><div class="third_circule"><h2>BUILD</h2></div><figcaption><em>Engineering from the inside out</em><br>Once the right solution has been pinpointed, it is time to take meticulous measures toward execution.
        All the pieces start coming together. We utilize varying technologies and resources to execute the project. </figcaption></figure>
    <figure><div class="fourth_circule"><h2>LAUNCH</h2></div><figcaption><em>Houston, we’ve got a solution</em><br>We put the spit-shine on our work and once we’re sure all development is complete,

    <figure><div class="fifth_circule"><h2>MANAGE</h2></div><figcaption><em>Rinse & Repeat</em><br>Over time, projects are monitored and processes are continuously
        re-evaluated. As soon as we find room for improvements, the cycle begins once more.</figcaption></figure>
